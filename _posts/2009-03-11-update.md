Its been a few days since I posted here so I thought I would give you an idea what I've been up to:
<ul>
	<li>School: Physics test today</li>
	<li>Work: Busier and busier</li>
	<li>Bikes</li>
	<li>Battling the never-ending cold</li>
</ul>
Upcoming events:
<ul>
	<li>Meet Radiology Oncologist on Friday</li>
	<li>Radiation begins on Monday</li>
</ul>
Anyways, I've been super busy. Hope you all are having a great week and I will post updates when I figure out what all this radiation is about, should be interesting.
