WOOOHOOOO, I'm sitting here with only about 1 more hour left on my 4th, count em, 4th chemo infusion!!!
This may not seem like a lot, but hey it means one thing ... I'm about half way done with the chemo part of my treatment! So in honor of this great day I have posted a certain video for you all to enjoy, and please feel free to dance along.
