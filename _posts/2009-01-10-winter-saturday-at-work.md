First just wanted to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JILL!
Also, today we decided to have a little buzz cut in the shop at work. I decided that I'm sick of my hair falling out on my pillows and clothes so I buzzed it to a number ONE guard. Here are some pictures for you to enjoy.

Special thanks to Codizzle for the chop job and another special thanks to Trilbone for getting his cut at the same time.
