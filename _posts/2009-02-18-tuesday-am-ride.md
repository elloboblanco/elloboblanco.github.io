Yesterday I went on my first mountain bike ride of the season! Up Kestrel and down Hulls Gulch! It was a cold one but I was just glad to be able to go. I haven't really ridden since about a month before my <a title="The Beginning" href="https://fosteri.zone/blog/2008/11/the-beginning/">diagnosis</a> (October), so needless to say I was pretty weak.
But nonetheless it was a great time, and we ended up finding a <a href="http://boisevelocache.blogspot.com/">VeloCache</a> on it too!
