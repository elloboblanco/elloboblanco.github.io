I pulled this off a buddies post of a post, originally from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/14/president-obamas-official-portrait-the-first-ever-taken-with-a/" target="_blank">Engadget.com</a>.
Despite differing political beliefs, there is one thing we can all agree on. This is interesting.
<blockquote><a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2009/01/obamasportrait.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 315px; height: 428px;" alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2009/01/obamasportrait.jpg" border="0" /></a>You're now gazing at President Barack Obama's just-released official portrait -- the first of a U.S. president ever taken with a digital camera. That means we can peek at the EXIF data -- this fine specimen of portraiture was snapped with a <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/17/21-1-megapixel-canon-eos-5d-mark-ii-with-full-frame-hd-video-ann/">Canon EOS 5D Mark II</a> on January 13th, 2009 at 5:38 pm with no flash, using a 105mm lens stopped to f/10 at a 1/125 exposure, with an ISO of 100 by newly crowned official White House photographer Pete Souza. Nice work, Souza -- but we think it could use a few lens flares.</blockquote>
