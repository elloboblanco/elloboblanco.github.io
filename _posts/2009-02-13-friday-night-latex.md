So I'm sitting here gloating over my recent score, a 93% on my Physics test! This is a drastic improvement from my earlier quiz score, as I regrettably remember.
This week has been ... busy. I got chemo on Monday, which didn't set me back much. Felt lively and ready for action pretty much all week, days #3 and #4 being the worst two as usual (slight nausea and shaking galore). But other than that, I'm looking forward to a three-day weekend and some time to relax for a day or so.
I wont let the nice weather fool me though, it will be back to business as soon as Monday rolls around. It will be my good week and it will be a great opportunity to get some things all lined up.
Registration for summer semester, for example, starts fairly soon. So getting that to go through will be a task in its own.
Tonight, I got exceedingly bored and finally worked out this <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTex</a> (math typesetting) stuff from my math class that allows me to insert correct mathematical symbols in a command line type of format.
This involved, downloading the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTex</a> required kits, and then <a href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEdt</a> which is turning out to be a great choice in a text editor, it has great features that work flawlessly and seamlessly to convert my .tex files to .dvi and then to .pdf I really couldn't ask for much better.
For more info on <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTex</a>Â read <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/%7Eotis/texpert2.pdf">this</a>.
So that's what my Friday night ended up with ... math computing, but hey, I'm not hating the extra study hours to review my notes and work with LaTex. For which the learning curve is very steep, but I think I'm well on my way up it.
