Well as most of the readers of this blog know, my birthday is June 21. My lovely family decided to buy me a bunch of computer parts for my new PC!!! So stoked that I get to build this one from scratch exactly like I want. Thanks goes to my mom, grandparents, sister, and dad, who unknowingly contributed too :). So see the pictures below for all the newest swag, I will be assembling this system and getting Windows 7 on it asap. With summer school though this could be a few weeks :(, oh well all in time I say. Besides I got my new monitor already hooked up to my old system (grad present from sister) :)
