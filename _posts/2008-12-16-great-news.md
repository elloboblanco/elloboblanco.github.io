I had another doctor appointment today and guess what!!!! My red blood cell count (RBC) is staying high for once and that means no more transfusions for a while he says! So other than that exciting news, nothing else has happened. Just thought I would put a quick note in here about that.
ALSO, I get my next CT scan in early 2009, so stay tuned for the update on size/placement/progress on all my problem areas.
