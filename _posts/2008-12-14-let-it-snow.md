Today I woke up feeling like they said I would, $1,000,000. Which to me ... is quite a bit of feel good! Hopefully this transfusion will last a bit longer this time and I can feel good all week-long.
I woke up this morning to a bunch of snow (for Boise) outside, it looks beautiful and reminds me why I love the winter so much, aside from the driving. Maybe this year we will even have a white Christmas. Who knows but for anyone interested I have a few pictures here outside my house of the snowfall (UPDATE: photos lost somewhere between 20yearsandthehodge.blogspot.com, williamgfoster.com, willfoster.doesntexist.org, and fosteri.zone). As you can probably see it's still falling, and there is no end in sight, they say its supposed to fall for the next four days! Anyways, thanks for reading and have a wonderful Sunday.
