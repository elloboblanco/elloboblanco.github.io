These commercials have been getting my attention lately.

It is an organization started by <a href="http://www.alesecoco.org/"> Alese Coco</a> and her Family, this girl was slightly younger than me when she go diagnosed with the EXACT same Hodgkins Lymphoma (Nodular Sclerosing Stage II). She has now passed on but her story really hit me hard since she has been through a lot. It reminds me that every day is awesome to live. This girl had her Hodgkins recur three times and eventually it got her. I can only hope that I'm fortunate enough to avoid a situation like hers.
Its funny since I've only been cancer free and in remission for nearly 6 months. Not even close to cured (considered cured after remission for 5 years). I cant let it get to my head, I need to live healthy, stay healthy, and be a good person.
