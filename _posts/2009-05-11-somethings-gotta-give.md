Something in the mail today,
"TOTAL <a href="http://www.varian.com/">RADIATION THERAPY</a> - $30,279.00"
"<a href="http://www.stlukesonline.org/cancer_care/">DOCTORS</a> GUIDANCE / MANAGING - $5,555.07"
And add this to the already billed $102,000 and I'm approaching a new grand total of around $140,000. Not trying to make any political statements or anything here but.
<ul>
	<li>What are your thoughts on the United States medical system?</li>
	<li>What needs to change?</li>
	<li>What can be improved?</li>
</ul>
I surely don't have a great answer to any of these questions, but I'd love to hear what YOU think. If there is one thing that I do know, it's that SOMETHINGS GOTTA GIVE. Our system is out of whack, there is no way a 20-year-old like myself could EVER afford this. Unless of course I was on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20045930,00.html">this list</a>. At least we all know I hold a place on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/gallery/0,,20159879_12,00.html">this one</a>.
So all's well, anyways, enjoy the sun and the great weather for a bike ride!
