That's right! I had my 6th session of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABVD" target="_blank">ABVD</a> today (minus the B). Many reasons for subtracting the B, first of all Big Willy don't need <em>all</em> of the chemo anymore, and second of all my "mass" is shrinking. All I hear now in the docs office is..
<ul>
 	<li>Textbook response</li>
 	<li>Great</li>
 	<li>Exactly what I thought</li>
</ul>
...These responses are much better than the ones I was hearing about 2 months (25lbs lighter) ago. Those were more desolate like...
<ul>
 	<li>Your going to lose your <a style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal;" title="Winter Saturday at Work" href="https://fosteri.zone/blog/2009/01/winter-saturday-at-work/" target="_blank">hair</a></li>
 	<li>Your going to feel nauseated</li>
 	<li>Your going to need to recover</li>
</ul>
...These, weren't so good for my overall morale. However, I just had #6 and I am feeling good. We will see how the recovery from this one is but I'm excited, Chemo + <a href="http://www.boisestate.edu/" target="_blank">School</a> is going to be a whole new experience. But overall, its nice to get out and about, on my bike, and in the sun's revealing rays.
Thanks for All the Support!
