Just got back from finding a <a href="http://boisevelocache.blogspot.com/">VeloCache</a> with my buddy <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06491538923339705487">Codizzle</a> and I got to thinking...Should I change the name of my blog now that I am done with my treatments? Let me know what you all think by voting on the right side of my page (you should find a poll). I am also thinking of updating the look/feel of my blog to be brighter, more...summerlike seeing as how we are getting closer and closer to such a seasonal shift.
My sister started a new blog, and she is an excellent writer so her posts are not nearly as...barbaric as my own. But if your interested in her studies/happenings/rants, feel free to check it out. She will be attending the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> getting her masters in Gender Studies (proud brother right here).
Today I've been working on getting the kinks/final touches worked out of my latest CS project. It is just a simple contact sorter/generator/editor. However it is the most advanced graphical program I have done so far so I am pretty excited about it!
Anyways, remember to vote and let me know how you feel about the name change, maybe 20yearskickedthehodge, or 20yearsoverthehodge, or many many others.
