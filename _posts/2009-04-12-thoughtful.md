As I sit here before work on this beautiful Easter Sunday morning, I'm updating my current bills for my treatment and I'm drawn to this number at the bottom of the spreadsheet we update. And the total billed for my 5 months of treatment is:
<h2 style="text-align: center;">$101,000</h2>
What can this get you? Well here are a few things... After one more Radiation Treatment I could have one of these

These things are just material possessions and you can't really put a price on the gift of life......blah blah blah :)
<p style="text-align: left;">But instead of all these cool things I get <a title="FINAL CHEMO VIDEO" href="https://fosteri.zone/blog/2009/02/final-chemo-video/">this</a> and <a title="Radiation Treatment #1" href="https://fosteri.zone/blog/2009/03/radiation-treatment-1/">this</a>. Oh well complaining gets nobody...nowhere.</p>
Cheers, and Happy Easter!
