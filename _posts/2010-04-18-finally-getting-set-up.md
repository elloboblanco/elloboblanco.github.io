These last few months have been a whirlwind, new job, new school assignments, fun fun fun. Busy the whole way through. Somehow I managed to get this website up and running though. Welcome to the new <a href="http://20yearsandthehodge.blogspot.com">www.20yearsandthehodge.blogspot.com</a>
I have revamped some things, check out the links, navigate the site, there is a pictures section and video section. I plan on getting some interactive programs on this site and am planning some fun bits for the summer. I encourage you to stay tuned, for now here is a picture of my ugly mug :)
