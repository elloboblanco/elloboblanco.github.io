So the site has so far been a success, not sure if anyone has been keeping up on the updates and whatnot. But if you access the main site <a href="https://fosteri.zone">fosteri.zone</a>Â then you can click around and see the new code examples that I have posted, even with syntax highlighting via HTML and JavaScript. Thanks to <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">Alex Gorbatchev</a> and his SyntaxHighlighter code project.
Other than that there is a new about me section and the menu structure has been changed a bit. I'm proud to say that I have wrapped my head around the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) so this weekend I worked a bit on converting all the code to run with these specifications. This has definitely made the process of coding the html for the site much easier. I now see the wisdom in this system.
Personally I have just finished my Spring semester at BSU and am currently working full-time at Sybase. My grades are holding and my GPA is still right where I'm desiring it to be for graduate school applications. Wish me luck :)
