Found this while browsing today. We are always talking about this very subject at work so I thought I would provide a little professional insight to the topic. I have no doubt my opinion is irrelevant but nonetheless...the article is interesting.
Pulled from <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-10211019-238.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">CNET.com</a> news.
<blockquote>Here's some good news that you should forward to your boss. A <a href="http://voice.unimelb.edu.au/news/5750/">study</a> conducted in Australia found that people who engage in "Workplace Internet Leisure Browsing" (WILB) are more productive than those who don't. Workers who "surf the Internet for fun at work--within a reasonable limit of less than 20 percent of their total time in the office--are more productive by about 9 percent," according to the study's author, Professor Brent Coker, from the University of Melbourne's Department of Management and Marketing.

The reason that "WILB" increases productivity, he said, is that "people need to zone out for a bit to get back their concentration. Think back to when you were in class listening to a lecture--after about 20 minutes your concentration probably went right down, yet after a break your concentration was restored."
A short break, such as surfing the Internet, "enables the mind to rest itself, leading to a higher total net concentration for a day's work, and as a result, increased productivity."
But this doesn't apply to everyone. Approximately 14 percent of the sample showed signs of Internet addiction and, for them, Web surfing can decrease productivity. The more they surfed at work, the less productive they were. The reason for this, he said, "is because of an 'urge' to search the Internet. "Those that aren't addicted, don't have this urge and they surf the Internet as a reward."
The study found that 70% of the 300 workers surveyed engage in "WILB." The report was released in Melbourne on April 2nd when it was still April 1st in the United States. In an email, Dr. Coker assured me that it's not an April fools joke.
I'm not sure whether the result of this Australian study applies to workers in the U.S. and other countries, but I for one have a vested interest in believing what he says. If nothing else, it's a great excuse, especially if your boss is giving you a hard time for "WILB."</blockquote>
Food for thought at least, also onlyÂ 15 more radiations left!!!!
