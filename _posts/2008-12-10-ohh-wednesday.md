So today is pretty much just another Wednesday, or Hump Day if you prefer, and that means one of two things. NauseaÂ is half way over, or half way begun. I tend to think its more likely to be the last one because last bad week it lasted through the weekend, not good at all. But we will see, I get to go in again this Friday to check my CBC (complete blood count) to see if I need another transfusion this weekend or not, hopefully they find my blood a bit quicker this time if needed. Other than that my shakiness seems to not be getting better making it somewhat difficult to type but oh well, nothing I'm not used to by now anyways haha.
