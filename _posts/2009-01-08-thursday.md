Oh what to say about Thursday, not much really. It's the third day after chemo on Monday so, naturally, today was a lesson in just how odd my body could feel. I felt shaky all day but kept my steady stream of anti-nausea meds running. I can only imagine how I would feel without these wondrous Rx's.
In my free time I built P-Nut a fun wall to play on above her cat post. I find these kind of activities gives me something fun and time-consuming to do. Anyways, here is a picture of her playing on it!
