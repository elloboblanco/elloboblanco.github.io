The quickest way to piss someone off...
Take away their ability to eat
Five lbs lost last week and dropping, doc says if I lose anymore its gonna be a bigger issue.
Let them drop, let all the lbs drop like the leaves from a tree I say. I can't get any lighter than my first sick weight (145 lbs). But at this rate I'll be there by the week after next. Yogurt, Instant Breakfast, and Smoothies only go so far.
