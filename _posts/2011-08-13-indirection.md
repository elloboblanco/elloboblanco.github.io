Well inter-webs, its been nearly a year. The site has undergone some updates to its look and feel, but the content remains the same, some outdated cancer posts, some random CS rants, etc.. This lack of content is one of the reasons for this post, to keep something new, to refresh this blog with a new invigorated sense of self. Much like myself, the blog needs some direction. Recently graduating from Boise State University has been an interesting journey, to say the least. Forgive the inner monologue of this post, I've been doing a lot of reflection lately.
The recent weeks have been a sort-of emotional roller coaster, do I stay safe, stay in my hometown (Boise, ID), do I choose the path to a nice house, nice yard, middle-class income, working 9-5 for the stockholders? Or do I devote my life to something more? Higher education? Social Good? Volunteer work? What can people with my degree (Computer Science) do that is socially good? This has really got me thinking about where I should take my career.
One of the great parts of Computer Science is ability to find a job most anywhere, in most any industry. Everyone needs a back-end software developer, everyone needs a website author, in this ever-increasing age of online "identity" people are struggling to make something of themselves in the real and digital worlds, creating a unified identity.
So enough with the boring stuff, there are a few recent projects which have peaked my attention through other blogs and social networks. <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code For America</a> has really peaked my interest and I am currently considering delving into these social good types of jobs. I just don't know how long I can work for the stockholders? If I pursue a career for another Fortune 500 will this increase my overall happiness? What will make me happy? This lack of happiness has been prevalent over everything I do, I need to find my calling, what have I been chosen to do? How can I, individually, make the world a better place for each and every person? Do I educate myself more? Do I gain real-world experience and amass meaningless sums of cash? Clearly there has to be more to life, there has to be something that I can do that will fulfill my desires. So I'm reaching out to you online world, what should I do? What do I devote my life to? What can I do that is socially good?
