Today is Physics class we watched a little film (clip below) profiling easily one of the greatest scientific minds of our civilization <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo">Galileo Galilei</a>. Thought it was well done and pretty interesting, anyhow check it out!

Good quote from the end of the movie talking about his telescope from a church leader to another:
