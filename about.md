<p>Welcome to <a href="http://locohost.fosteri.zone" data-type="URL" data-id="locohost.fosteri.zone">locohost.fosteri.zone</a>, my corner of the internet!<br>I'm a graduate from <a rel="noopener" href="http://boisestate.edu/" target="_blank">Boise State University</a> with a Bachelors of Science in <a rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>. I enjoy most anything having to do with computers, software, and hardware. The goal of this site is to write about cool projects I'm involved in and document my life to some extent. That being said, this is my personal blog and I occasionally post personal thoughts/opinions.</p>
